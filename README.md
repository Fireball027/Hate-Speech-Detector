## Overview

The **Hate Speech Detection Project** applies **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Machine Learning (ML)** to identify and classify hate speech in social media tweets. By leveraging text preprocessing, feature extraction, and classification algorithms, this project aims to automate the detection of offensive or harmful language in online conversations.

---

## Key Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleans and tokenizes Twitter data for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Identifies common patterns in hate speech vs. non-hate speech tweets.
- **Feature Engineering**: Uses **TF-IDF** vectorization for text representation.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Implements classifiers such as **Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and SVM**.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assesses accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix.

## Project Files

### 1. `twitter_data.csv`
This dataset contains Twitter tweet data labeled as either hate speech or non-hate speech. Key fields include:
- **tweet**: The text content of the tweet.
- **label**: Classification label (0 = Non-Hate Speech, 1 = Hate Speech).

### 2. `main.py`
This script processes the dataset, trains classification models, and evaluates their performance.

#### Key Components:

- **Data Loading & Cleaning**:
  - Reads and preprocesses text data from `twitter_data.csv`.
  - Removes special characters, stopwords, and URLs.

- **Feature Engineering**:
  - Uses **TF-IDF Vectorization** to convert text into numerical format.

- **Model Training & Evaluation**:
  - Splits data into training and test sets.
  - Trains machine learning models such as **Logistic Regression, SVM, and Random Forest**.
  - Evaluates models using **accuracy, F1-score, and confusion matrix**.

#### Example Code:
```python
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report, confusion_matrix

# Load dataset
data = pd.read_csv('twitter_data.csv')

# Text vectorization
vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer(stop_words='english')
X = vectorizer.fit_transform(data['tweet'])
y = data['label']

# Train-test split
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.3, random_state=42)

# Train model
model = RandomForestClassifier()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predictions
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Evaluation
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))
sns.heatmap(confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred), annot=True, cmap='coolwarm')
plt.show()
```

## Future Enhancements

- **Deep Learning Models**: Implement **LSTMs or Transformer-based models** for improved accuracy.
- **Multi-Class Classification**: Differentiate between offensive, abusive, and hate speech.
- **Real-Time Analysis**: Deploy a real-time hate speech detection system.
- **Explainable AI (XAI)**: Provide insights into why a tweet was classified as hate speech.
